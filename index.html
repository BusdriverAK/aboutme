<h3>About me:</h3>
      <p>I was born and raised in Fairbanks, Alaska. With long winters and small cities my life quickly started to revolve around technology, video games, and skiing. However, extreme temperatures and very little day light meant I spent less time on the slopes and more time building computers and playing games.
      </p>
      <p>After leaving Alaska I made it a point to experience all of the things unavailble back home. I constantly travelled (so for work with the Navy), hopping from event to event, or planning trips with friends (turns out skiing is a lot better outside of Fairbanks). Post Navy I decided I want to continues to learn and experience new things, and as always, options were less available in Alaska</p>
      <p>After deciding to make a career in software development, that has been my main goal since. First to San Diego for some education, and now finally to Seattle.</p>
